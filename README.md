# Stringtale Action

Stringtale simplifies text edits by allowing changes without a CMS or code diggingâ€”edits go directly to pull requests, making content management easy for your entire team, from developers to non-developers.

This action is a wrapper around the [Stringtale CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stringtale/cli). It allows you to run Stringtale in your CI and automatically create pull requests for text changes.

## Usage
For more information on how to use this action, please refer to the [Stringtale CLI documentation](https://docs.stringtale.com/usage/github-action/).
